# Hypermeet 2017

## When

3-6 August, 2017


## Location

Leipzig. We have 3 apartment for 4 people in each, plenty of space. Two apartments in the same building, the other one is around the corner.

Its close to city center, like 3 tram stops, and there is a tram stop right outside.

### Transport

* Train: from Berlin looks pretty ok. 90 minutes direct connection like â‚¬30-40.
* Flying: If you want.
* Car: There might be one or two cars going to Leipzig. Of course there will be limited space but one probably from the north and possibly one from the west. Both can pick up in Germany, presumably. Let me know and I might be able to hook you up.
